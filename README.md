# Encompass Request Loan Data from API and Post to Webhook in Node.js

This will take an auth key and loan ID and request the loan data from Ellie Mae Encompass. I built a flow using triggers from Encompass to Zapier, then from Zapier to AWS Lambda with this script, then back to Zapier to finish putting data points in the right places.

If you need help with this kind of work let me know !! devkore.com
